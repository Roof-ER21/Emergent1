<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed the Roof-HR application, an enterprise HR management system, transforming it into a 4-in-1 suite. Initial phases included the QR Code Generator's backend and dynamic frontend, HR module implementations (onboarding, PTO, compliance, project assignment, employee dashboard), and Google Sheets integration. A recurring challenge was persistent frontend compilation errors in , often requiring  and  intervention. More recently, the focus shifted to enhancing the Sales Leaderboard with signup tracking, goal progress bars, and role-based dashboards. Following successful backend API completion and debugging of frontend loading issues (auth token and state management fixes), a comprehensive design system overhaul based on new design specs was initiated and largely completed across the Central Hub, HR, and QR apps. The engineer then focused on implementing automated goal setting and bonus tier automation in the Sales Leaderboard, setting up automated Google Sheets sync for signup data, enhancing the HR recruitment tab with a Kanban/list pipeline and filtering, and simplifying the QR app with an interactive savings calculator. The system is declared fully functional and production-ready.

<product_requirements>
The Roof-HR application is a comprehensive, customizable, scalable, secure, no-code/low-code 4-in-1 HR management suite for roofing companies. It features a Central Hub for login and three main applications: Sales Leaderboard, HR Recruitment, and QR Code Generator.

**QR Code Generator**: Generates unique QR codes for sales reps, leading to personalized landing pages for lead tracking and homeowner forms. Features include Analytics & Reporting, Bulk QR Code Generation, Custom QR Designs, and Bulk Export. Its UI/UX was modernized. Recently, customer info uploading was removed, and an interactive savings calculator was added (showing ,500 less than user input).

**HR Recruitment**: Manages employee onboarding with automated flows, PTO tracking, Safety & Compliance (for 1099 workers' comp submission), and an employee dashboard. It supports type-specific hiring flows (Insurance, Retail, Office, Production) with a modern UI. It was enhanced with a Kanban and list-style candidate pipeline, stage filtering, workflow automation (emails, interview scheduling), and notes/comments. The project assignment feature was explicitly removed.

**Sales Leaderboard**: Tracks signups (monthly/yearly from leads and QR codes), displays goal progress bars, and provides role-based dashboards. Sales Reps see personal numbers, Team Leads assign monthly signup goals (1st-6th of month), and Admin/Sales Managers manage yearly revenue goals, competitions, contests, and a bonus system (Tier 1: 15 signups, Tier 6: 40 signups). Automated signup data sync (3 times daily from Google Sheets) and manual revenue updates by Admin/Sales Managers were implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing significant enhancements to both the HR Recruitment module and the QR Code Generator app.

For the **HR Recruitment module**, the focus was on transforming the Hiring Flows tab into a robust **Kanban-style and list-style candidate pipeline**.
1.  **Kanban Pipeline**: A 7-stage (Applied, Screening, Interview, Reference Check, Offer, Hired, Declined) drag-and-drop interface for visual candidate management was implemented.
2.  **List View Enhancement**: The existing list view was made **filterable by stage**. This involved adding clickable stage buttons at the top of the list, displaying real-time candidate counts next to each stage name. Clicking a stage filters the table to show only candidates in that specific stage, with All Candidates showing the total count.
3.  **Workflow Automation**: Functions for email automation triggered by stage changes, interview scheduling, and a system for adding and viewing notes/comments for each candidate were integrated into the recruitment workflow.
4.  **Module Streamlining**: As per user request, the Project Assignments tab and its associated content and logic were completely removed from the HR management system to streamline its focus.

For the **QR Code Generator app**, the focus was on simplification and new functionality:
1.  **Customer Info Upload Removal**: The process of uploading customer information was removed from the QR app's interface to streamline the user experience.
2.  **Interactive Savings Calculator**: The Calculate Your Savings button was revamped to trigger an **interactive side bubble modal**. Users can input their estimated roof cost, and the calculator instantly displays a savings amount that is ,500 less than their input, accompanied by visual feedback and a call-to-action (Get My Free Inspection).

Prior to these, critical runtime errors in the Sales Leaderboard (e.g., ) were thoroughly fixed by adding null/undefined checks and fallback values across all relevant data displays. The UI also received a unified red color scheme across various buttons and action items for consistent branding. The system was confirmed fully functional and production-ready after each major enhancement, with comprehensive backend and frontend testing.
