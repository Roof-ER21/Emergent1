The AI engineer was tasked with building an enterprise HR management system, Roof-HR, envisioned as a no-code/low-code solution. Initially, the project was interpreted as a single web application with various modules. The AI engineer successfully established a React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) architecture with MongoDB, implemented JWT-based authentication, core CRUD for employees and jobs, and a sales rep dashboard. Key integrations like Gmail SMTP and Google Sheets were planned and partly set up.

A critical misunderstanding arose regarding the application's structure. The user explicitly clarified the need for a 4-in-1 system comprising a central hub and three separate, distinct applications (Sales Leaderboard, HR Recruitment, QR Code Generator). The AI engineer refactored the frontend to accommodate this, also implementing a development login bypass and applying a consistent color scheme.

Most recently, the user provided more detailed requirements for the QR Code Generator app, emphasizing role-based access (everyone accesses all apps, but views differ based on role), and specific features for individual sales rep landing pages (picture, video, contact, CTA, lead form with admin distribution). The AI engineer was in the process of implementing this complex QR code feature when the summary was requested. The trajectory shows iterative development with continuous frontend and backend testing, and a focus on visual validation via screenshots.

<product_requirements>
Roof-HR is an enterprise-level, all-in-one management system for roofing companies (80-500+ employees). The core objective is to replace fragmented legacy systems with a comprehensive, customizable, scalable, secure, and easily deployable no-code/low-code solution.
The system is built as a **4-in-1 suite**: a Central Hub for login and app selection, and three individual applications:
1.  **Sales Leaderboard App**: Tracks personal performance, sales rankings, active competitions, and growth analytics.
2.  **HR Recruitment App**: Manages applicant tracking, interview scheduling, status tracking (New → Review → Interview → Hired/Rejected), and performance metrics.
3.  **QR Code Generator App**: Generates unique QR codes and individual landing pages for sales reps and new hires.
    *   **Features for Sales/Admin Managers**: Creation of landing pages, linking QR codes to employee profiles, contact information management, department/territory filtering, lead tracking, and mobile-optimized interface.
    *   **Features for Sales Reps (on their landing page)**: Display of their picture (top left), a welcome video (top right), an About Me section with contact info, and a call-to-action (CTA).
    *   **Lead Management**: Homeowners fill signup forms on landing pages; sales reps are alerted, but leads are routed to admin for distribution.

The system features robust role-based access control, ensuring everyone can access all apps but with varying levels of visibility and functionality. The UI must adhere to the theroofdocs.com color scheme: primary red (#ef4444), black (#1f2937), white (#ffffff), and gray (#6b7280).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core FastAPI application. It defines API endpoints, handles database interactions (MongoDB), and manages authentication. Initially, it set up JWT authentication and basic CRUD operations for users, employees, and jobs. It was updated multiple times via  to include endpoint logic for authentication, and to integrate with Gmail SMTP. It's crucial for backend logic, data persistence, and API exposure.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains environment variables for the backend, specifically  for database connection and newly added Gmail SMTP credentials (e.g., , ). This file is vital for sensitive configuration.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This is the main React component responsible for the entire frontend structure, routing, and UI.
    -   **Initial State**: Contained monolithic application logic with Google OAuth integration for login.
    -   **First Major Update (Chat 74)**: Implemented a Development Login bypass for easier testing and applied the  color scheme (red, black, white, gray) across various UI components (buttons, headers, cards). It also included initial dashboard, employee, job, and commission views.
    -   **Second Major Update (Chat 92, 109, 128)**: Refactored significantly to implement the 4-in-1 system architecture. This involved creating a central hub/launcher component that dynamically renders three separate application components (Sales Leaderboard, HR Recruitment, QR Code Generator) based on user role and selection. It also included fixes for React component rendering and  wrapping issues. The most recent update (Chat 128) started the implementation of the comprehensive QR Code Generator app, which will include specific UI elements for sales rep landing pages. This file is central to how the user interacts with the application and how different modules are presented.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains global CSS styles for the frontend. It was updated to apply the  color palette (red, black, white, gray) uniformly across the application's UI elements, ensuring consistent branding.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>

- Complete Google Sheets integration for employee/sales rep import.
- Implementation of the comprehensive QR Code Generator app, including:
    -   Individual landing pages for sales reps with picture, welcome video, About Me, contact info, and CTA.
    -   Lead capture form on landing pages with rep alerts and admin distribution.
- Fine-tuning role-based access to ensure everyone has access to all apps with different levels of what they can see, as clarified by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the comprehensive QR Code Generator application and its associated features as detailed in Chat Message 126. This includes creating individual landing pages for sales reps, displaying their picture, a welcome video, an About Me section with contact information, and a Call-to-Action (CTA). The lead capture mechanism, where homeowners fill out a signup form, sales reps are alerted, and leads are distributed to administrators, is also part of this ongoing task. The AI engineer had just updated  (Chat Message 128) to begin incorporating these new QR code and landing page functionalities and was attempting to take a screenshot to visualize the progress (Chat Message 129). This work involves significant frontend changes to create the dynamic landing pages and backend integration to handle QR code generation and lead management.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the detailed QR Code Generator app features, focusing on the sales rep landing page elements and lead management workflow.
