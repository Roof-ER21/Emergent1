The trajectory details the AI engineer's transition from initial 0 to 1 development of the Roof-HR 4-in-1 application to continuous enhancement. Initially, the focus was on building the core QR Code Generator, HR modules (onboarding, PTO, compliance, project assignment), Google Sheets integration, and Sales Leaderboard. A recurring challenge was  compilation errors. The system was deemed fully functional and production-ready after a comprehensive design system overhaul and implementation of advanced Sales Leaderboard features, HR Recruitment Kanban, and QR app simplification. Subsequently, the user introduced new requirements for the Sales Leaderboard (bar graphs, % to goal, multi-color pace), further QR app simplification (email to sales managers only), and a significant UI redesign for QR landing pages (condensing sections, making layout horizontal). The AI engineer began implementing these new UI and leaderboard enhancements, updating , modifying  for bar graphs, and initiating horizontal layout changes, pausing mid-way through updating the Complete Project Solution section.

<product_requirements>
The Roof-HR application is a 4-in-1 HR management suite for roofing companies, featuring a Central Hub, Sales Leaderboard, HR Recruitment, and QR Code Generator.

**QR Code Generator**: Generates unique QR codes for sales reps with personalized landing pages for lead tracking. It previously included Analytics, Bulk QR generation, custom designs, and bulk export. Recent updates removed customer info upload and added an interactive savings calculator (showing ,500 less than input). *New Requirement:* Further simplify; only sales managers should receive the filled form via email. The landing pages need to be condensed (e.g., Our Services and About Us side-by-side) and made more horizontal/less vertically long.

**HR Recruitment**: Manages employee onboarding, PTO, Safety & Compliance (for 1099 workers' comp), and an employee dashboard. It supports type-specific hiring flows with a modern UI. It was enhanced with a 7-stage Kanban and list-style candidate pipeline (filterable by stage with real-time counts), workflow automation (emails, interview scheduling), and notes/comments. The project assignment feature was explicitly removed.

**Sales Leaderboard**: Tracks signups (monthly/yearly from leads/QR codes) and provides role-based dashboards. Sales Reps see personal numbers; Team Leads assign monthly goals; Admin/Sales Managers manage yearly revenue goals, competitions, and a bonus system (Tier 1: 15 signups, Tier 6: 40 signups). Automated signup data sync (3x daily from Google Sheets) and manual revenue updates were implemented. *New Requirement:* Display monthly and yearly progress using bar graphs with distinct colors for each, showing percentage to goal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing new user requirements focusing on enhancing the Sales Leaderboard and revamping the QR Code Generator's landing page UI.

For the **Sales Leaderboard**, the task involved upgrading the visual representation of goal progress. The engineer identified existing simple progress bars and started replacing them with more detailed bar graphs using the  library. This involves adding functionality to display both monthly and yearly pace with distinct colors and percentages to goal. The  file was modified to implement these changes in the main leaderboard display and the revenue section.

For the **QR Code Generator app's landing pages**, the focus was on layout optimization to make them less vertically long and more horizontally condensed. The user specifically requested placing Our Services and About Us sections side-by-side. The engineer successfully modified the Services Section in  to utilize a 2-column grid layout for a more horizontal appearance. The trajectory concluded while the engineer was in the process of applying similar horizontal layout adjustments to the Complete Project Solution section within .

The  file was updated at the beginning of this current work cycle to reflect the new set of tasks.
