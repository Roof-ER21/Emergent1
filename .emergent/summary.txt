The AI engineer successfully developed the Roof-HR application, an enterprise HR management system, evolving it into a 4-in-1 suite. Initial work focused on the QR Code Generator, including backend APIs and a dynamic frontend with UI/UX enhancements (dark theme, content refactoring). A major challenge involved resolving persistent frontend compilation errors in  due to duplicate component declarations and orphaned JSX, which were debugged through iterative fixes and git history restoration, often requiring the  to diagnose file corruption. The engineer then implemented Google Sheets integration for employee/sales rep import (backend passed tests) and comprehensive HR modules (onboarding, PTO, safety/compliance adjusted to only compliance, project assignment, employee dashboard). Following this, the user requested significant enhancements to the Sales Leaderboard app, including detailed signup tracking, multi-colored goal progress bars, role-based dashboards (Sales Rep, Team Lead, Admin/Sales Manager), and a bonus system. The AI engineer commenced backend model and API endpoint updates for these new Leaderboard features but encountered file corruption in , leading to a shift in focus to the frontend.

<product_requirements>
The Roof-HR application is an enterprise HR management system for roofing companies, designed to be a comprehensive, customizable, scalable, secure, and no-code/low-code 4-in-1 suite. It includes a Central Hub for login and three main applications: Sales Leaderboard, HR Recruitment, and QR Code Generator.

**QR Code Generator:** Generates unique QR codes for sales reps, leading to personalized landing pages displaying rep info, videos, and CTAs. It includes lead tracking, homeowner forms, sales rep alerts, and admin lead distribution, with role-based access. Five priority features were implemented: Advanced File Upload UI, Analytics & Reporting, Bulk QR Code Generation, Custom QR Designs, and Bulk Export Functionality. Recently, its UI/UX was significantly modernized with gradient backgrounds, animations, enhanced metrics, and professional filtering.

**HR Recruitment:** Initially focused on user-friendly employee onboarding with automated flows, admin/sales manager edit capabilities, PTO tracking for W2 employees, Safety & Compliance for 1099 employees (specifically workers comp submission within 2 weeks of start), detailed project assignment showing QR scans, and an employee dashboard. User later requested to remove safety and training but retain compliance requirements, and to build specific hiring flows for Insurance Hires, Retail Hires, Office Hires, and Production Hires, with a modern, standout UI maintaining the existing color scheme.

**Sales Leaderboard:** Originally a placeholder, it was recently modernized with a gradient header, podium system for top performers, and three professional tabs: Leaderboard, Competitions, and Analytics. Current requirements include tracking signups from leads (monthly/yearly) and QR codes, a two-color bar for goal progress (current vs. yearly pace). Role-based dashboards are critical: Sales Reps see their comprehensive numbers/charts and the general leaderboard; Team Leads see their dashboard, the leaderboard, and a team management page to view/assign signup goals (1-6th of month) for their team members; Admin/Sales Managers see everything, plus an admin page to add/adjust yearly revenue goals and manage competitions/contests, and a bonus system tied to monthly signups (Tier 1-6, no money figures).

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture, utilizing React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the FastAPI backend's core, managing API endpoints, MongoDB interactions, authentication (JWT), and external services. It houses business logic and data exposure.
    -   **Importance**: Central to the application's functionality, handling all data processing and API responses.
    -   **Changes Made**: Substantial additions for the QR Code Generator (Pydantic models for SalesRep, Lead, QR generation helpers, lead notifications, API routes like , , , ). Dev token bypass for . Comprehensive Google Sheets integration functions were added, including an updated . Extensive new Pydantic models (, , , , , , , , ) and API endpoints were implemented for various HR modules (onboarding, PTO, safety, project assignment, employee dashboards). Most recently, new models (, ) and API endpoints (e.g., , ) for type-specific hiring flows (Insurance, Retail, Office, Production) were added, replacing safety training with compliance requirements. Attempts were made to add new models and API endpoints for the enhanced Sales Leaderboard (tracking signups, goals, competitions), but this work was interrupted by file corruption.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for secure configuration, holding , , .
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added for Google Sheets integration.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component, managing overall structure, routing, and UI.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates user interaction, implements the 4-in-1 system, and contains much of the frontend logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive refactoring for App Hub and sub-applications. Integrated QR Code Generator API calls, file uploads, UI states. Updated global CSS for dark theme. Content updates (Free Estimates to Free Inspections, grid layouts). Implementation of advanced file upload UI, analytics, bulk QR generation, custom QR designs, and bulk export. The  component was expanded from a placeholder to include comprehensive HR management and type-specific hiring flow functionality. This file was a frequent source of persistent syntax errors (duplicate component declarations, orphaned JSX) throughout the trajectory, specifically for the  and other functions, which were iteratively resolved, often with  and  assistance. The QR Generator App and Sales Leaderboard App have both undergone significant UI/UX modernization, including gradient cards, animations, and enhanced filtering/dashboard features.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains global CSS styles for the React frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures consistent visual identity and dark theme implementation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to incorporate the  color palette and implement the dark theme.
-   **/app/test_result.md**: Documents testing data, previous communications, and user problem statements.
    -   **Importance**: Crucial for tracking testing protocols, outcomes, and agent communications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated throughout the trajectory to reflect backend and frontend testing results, especially for Google Sheets integration, HR module testing, and the Sales Leaderboard. It was updated to reflect backend changes for hiring flows and to manage the current focus of development.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with transforming the Sales Leaderboard app into a comprehensive, functional performance tracking system with role-based dashboards. This new request from the user includes tracking signups from leads (month and year) and from QR codes, showing current vs. yearly pace in the goal progress bar, and implementing distinct dashboards for Sales Reps, Team Leads, and Admin/Sales Managers, including functionalities like assigning monthly signup goals (1st-6th of month) for team members (Team Leads) and managing yearly revenue goals, competitions, and contests (Admin/Sales Managers), along with a bonus system tied to signups (Tier 1 to Tier 6).

The AI engineer started by initiating Phase 1: Backend Models and Data Structure.
1.  **Backend Models ()**: New Pydantic models for tracking signups, goals, and competitions were added to .
2.  **Backend API Endpoints ()**: An attempt was made to add new API endpoints to support the enhanced leaderboard functionality.

However, during the process of adding the API endpoints for the new leaderboard features in , the file became corrupted. The AI engineer reverted the  file to its last working state using  and restarted the backend service.

Following this setback, the AI engineer decided to pivot and focus on Phase 2: Enhanced Frontend Implementation first, intending to leverage existing QR Generator backend data as a foundation where applicable. The last action recorded was a successful edit to  to begin updating the  component with role-based dashboards and comprehensive functionality. The frontend service was then restarted.
