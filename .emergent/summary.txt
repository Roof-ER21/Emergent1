The previous AI engineer successfully developed the Roof-HR application, an enterprise HR management system, transforming it into a 4-in-1 suite. Initial phases included the QR Code Generator's backend and dynamic frontend, HR module implementations (onboarding, PTO, compliance, project assignment, employee dashboard), and Google Sheets integration. A recurring challenge was persistent frontend compilation errors in , often requiring  and  intervention. More recently, the focus shifted to enhancing the Sales Leaderboard with signup tracking, goal progress bars, and role-based dashboards. The AI engineer commenced backend model updates for the Leaderboard, but file corruption in  led to a pivot to frontend development. Following successful backend API completion and debugging of frontend loading issues (auth token and state management fixes), a comprehensive design system overhaul based on new design specs was initiated and largely completed across the Central Hub, HR, and QR apps. The current task involves implementing advanced Sales Leaderboard features, specifically enhancing competition management and starting automated goal setting and bonus tier automation within the Admin tab.

<product_requirements>
The Roof-HR application is a comprehensive, customizable, scalable, secure, no-code/low-code 4-in-1 HR management suite for roofing companies. It features a Central Hub for login and three main applications: Sales Leaderboard, HR Recruitment, and QR Code Generator.

**QR Code Generator**: Generates unique QR codes for sales reps, leading to personalized landing pages for lead tracking, homeowner forms, and sales rep alerts. Implemented features include Advanced File Upload UI, Analytics & Reporting, Bulk QR Code Generation, Custom QR Designs, and Bulk Export. Its UI/UX was recently modernized with gradients, animations, enhanced metrics, and filtering.

**HR Recruitment**: Manages employee onboarding with automated flows, PTO tracking, Safety & Compliance (specifically for 1099 workers' comp submission), detailed project assignment, and an employee dashboard. User modifications included removing safety and training while retaining compliance requirements, and building type-specific hiring flows (Insurance, Retail, Office, Production) with a modern UI.

**Sales Leaderboard**: Evolved from a placeholder to a performance tracking system. Current requirements include tracking signups (monthly/yearly from leads and QR codes), two-color goal progress bars (current vs. yearly pace), and role-based dashboards. Sales Reps see personal numbers and the general leaderboard. Team Leads manage their dashboard, leaderboard, and assign monthly signup goals (1st-6th of month). Admin/Sales Managers manage yearly revenue goals, competitions, contests, and a bonus system (Tier 1-6 tied to monthly signups).

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the FastAPI backend's core, handling API endpoints, MongoDB, authentication, and external services.
    -   **Importance**: Central to business logic and data exposure.
    -   **Changes Made**: Significant additions for QR Code Generator, Google Sheets integration (including ), comprehensive HR modules (Pydantic models for , , , etc., and corresponding API endpoints). New  and  models and API endpoints were added, replacing safety training with compliance requirements. Sales Leaderboard models (, , , , , ) were added and API endpoints implemented after a file corruption issue was resolved via .
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for secure configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component, managing overall structure, routing, and UI.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates user interaction and implements the 4-in-1 system.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive refactoring for App Hub and sub-applications. Integrated QR Code Generator API calls, UI enhancements, and the  component's functionality. This file was a frequent source of syntax errors during development, iteratively resolved with  and . The  component was significantly updated to remove mock data and integrate with new backend APIs. Recent changes include: fixing authentication (static dev token), correcting  loading logic, and implementing a comprehensive design system overhaul for the Central Hub, HR Recruitment, and QR Code Generator apps. Advanced features like Analytics and Competition management have been started for the Sales Leaderboard.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Contains global CSS styles for the React frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures consistent visual identity and dark theme implementation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the Sales Leaderboard app. This involved Phase 1: Backend Models and Data Structure where new Pydantic models for tracking signups, goals, and competitions were added to , along with corresponding API endpoints. A file corruption issue in  during this phase necessitated a .

Following this, the AI engineer shifted focus to Phase 2: Enhanced Frontend Implementation. The  component in  was updated to remove mock data and integrate with the newly confirmed working backend APIs. Initial attempts faced frontend loading issues which were debugged and resolved by:
1.  Correcting the authentication token logic (from dynamic  to static ).
2.  Fixing the  logic within  that caused data loading to hang due to incorrect state variable checks.
3.  Adding extensive console logging to trace data flow, confirming successful API responses (200 OK for all leaderboard endpoints).

After successful debugging, the Sales Leaderboard became fully functional with real backend data, proper loading states, and role-based views.

The user then requested a comprehensive design system overhaul, maintaining the Roof HR Hub name. The AI engineer started implementing this Phase 1: Individual App Design Upgrades.
1.   was completely rewritten to align with the new Roof-ER design system, and  was installed.
2.  The  component in  was updated with the new design, including animations and a dark theme.
3.  Text contrast issues on the dark background were identified and resolved by adjusting CSS variables and using explicit color classes.
4.  The HR Recruitment app in  underwent a significant design upgrade, applying the new styling, animations, and improved UX.
5.  The QR Code Generator app in  was also enhanced with the new design system, particularly its header and overall styling.

Currently, the AI engineer is in Phase 2: Advanced Sales Leaderboard Features.  was installed, and the Analytics Tab with charts was added to the Sales Leaderboard. The Enhanced Competition Management System was also started, with advanced tournament features being added to the Competitions tab. The last action was an attempt to implement Automated Goal Setting System and Bonus Tier Automation within the Admin tab, which resulted in a linting error in .
